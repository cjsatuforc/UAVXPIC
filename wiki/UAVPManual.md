# UAVP Manual #
This is the original UAVP manual.
Much of the info is still current except for the recommended parameters which are quite different for the UAVX firmware. There is a newer board that has different regulators for the 3.3v and 5v Vcc, but most of the pins and connectors are the same.  

See: Manual Profi-Ufo V3_14 EN.pdf and UAVP_Schematic.pdf
