Legacy multicopter and fixed wing flight control firmware originally based on UAVP. Uses Microchip PIC18F2620 processor and original UAVP board sensors or various sensor collections including, FreeIMU and Drotek.  

For occasional revisions released post 2015 use UAVXArm tools.

Mainly for historical/legacy interest.
