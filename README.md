UAVXPIC
=======

Multicopter and fixed wing flight controller originally based on UAVP. Uses PIC18F2620 processor and original UAVP board or various sensor collections including, FreeIMU and Drotek, inserted in I2C socket.  

For occasional revisions released post 2015 use UAVXArm tools.

Mainly for historical/legacy interest.
